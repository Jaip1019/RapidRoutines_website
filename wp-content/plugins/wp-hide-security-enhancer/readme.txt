== Description ==

Effortlessly conceal your WordPress site from detection! With over 99.99% of hacks targeting specific plugin and theme vulnerabilities, this plugin significantly boosts site security by making it invisible to hackers' web scanners. 

By removing all traces of WordPress, including themes and plugins, potential exploits are rendered harmless. This method ensures that your site is safe without affecting SEO; in fact, it can enhance certain SEO aspects when used strategically.


WP-Hide has launched the **easiest way to completely hide your WordPress** core files, login page, theme and plugins paths from being shown on front side. This is a huge improvement over Site Security, since no one will know whether you are running or not a WordPress. It also provides a simple way to clean up html by removing all WordPress fingerprints.

**No file and directory change!**
No file and directory will be changed anywhere. Everything is processed virtually. The plugin code uses URL rewrite techniques and WordPress filters to apply all internal functionality and features. Everything is done automatically without user intervention required at all.

**Real hide of WordPress core files and plugins**
The plugin not only allows you to change default URLs of you WordPress, but it also hides/blocks such defaults. Other similar plugins, just change the slugs, but the defaults are still accessible, obviously revealing WordPress as CMS.

You can change the default WordPress login URL from wp-admin and wp-login.php to something totally arbitrary. No one will ever know where to try to guess a login and hack into your site. It becomes totally invisible.

When testing with WordPress theme and plugins detector services/sites, any setting change may not reflect right away on their reports, since they use cache. So, you may want to check again later, or try a different inner URL. Homepage URL usage is not mandatory.

Being the best content management system, widely used, WordPress is susceptible to a large range of hacking attacks including brute-force, SQL injections, XSS, XSRF etc. Despite the fact the WordPress core is a very secure code maintained by a team of professional enthusiast, the additional plugins and themes make ita vulnerable spot for every website. In many cases, those are created by pseudo-developers who do not follow the best coding practices or simply do not own the experience to create a secure plugin.
Statistics reveal that every day new vulnerabilities are discovered, many affecting hundreds of thousands of WordPress websites.
Over 99,9% of hacked WordPress websites are target of automated malware scripts, which search for certain WordPress fingerprints. This plugin hides or replaces those traces, making the hacking boots attacks useless.

It works well with custom WordPress directory structures,e.g. custom plugins, themes, and upload folders.

Once configured, you need to **clear server cache data and/or any cache plugins** (e.g. W3 Cache), for a new html data to be created. If you use CDN this should be cache clear as well.

**No other plugin functionality will be blocked or interfered in any way by WP-Hide**

This plugin allows to change the default Admin URL from **wp-login.php** and **wp-admin** to something else. All original links turn the default theme to “404 Not Found” page, as if nothing exists there. Besides the huge security advantage, the WP-Hide plugin saves lots of server processing time by reducing php code and MySQL usage since brute-force attacks target the weakURL.

**Important:** Compared to all other similar plugins which mainly use redirects, this plugin turns a default theme to“404 error” page for all **blocked URL** functionalities, without revealing the link existence at all.

Since version 1.2, WP-Hide change individual plugin URLs and made them unrecognizable. For example,the change of the default WooCommerce plugin URL and its dependencies from domain.com/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/ into domain.com/ecommerce/cdn/ or anything customized.

= Can I Use the Plugin on an Nginx Server? =

The free version of the plugin cannot generate the required Nginx rewrite rules for full-stack Nginx servers. However, it is fully compatible with Apache, LiteSpeed, IIS, and Nginx when used as a reverse proxy.
For Nginx conside  <a target="_blank" href="https://wp-hide.com">WP Hide PRO</a>.

= Can I Still Update WordPress, Plugins, and Themes? =

Yes, everything works as usual. The plugin does not interfere with your ability to update WordPress core, plugins, or themes. You can run updates at any time without any issues.

= Does the Plugin Affect My Website’s SEO? =

Not at all. The plugin only modifies asset links (such as CSS, JavaScript, and media files) and does not alter actual content URLs. There is no negative impact on SEO whatsoever.

= Is the Plugin Compatible with My Site’s Cache? =

Yes, the plugin works seamlessly with any caching plugin installed on your site.

= What Are HTTP Security Headers? =

HTTP Security Headers are a powerful tool to enhance your website’s security. The plugin simplifies the process of adding these headers through an intuitive graphical interface—no coding or manual file editing required.

= Which Servers Are Compatible with This Plugin? =

The free version of WP-Hide works seamlessly with Apache and IIS servers, as well as any setup that relies on .htaccess for configuration. For other server types, consider upgrading to the <a target="_blank" href="https://wp-hide.com">WP Hide PRO</a> version.

= How Can I Use the Plugin with My OpenLiteSpeed Server? =

If you’re running OpenLiteSpeed, here are a few steps to ensure compatibility:

* Verify that your server processes the .htaccess file, where rewrite rules are stored. For more details, refer to this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.litespeedtech.com/support/forum/threads/htaccess-is-ignored.15500/">support thread</a>.

* If you’re using the LiteSpeed Cache plugin, disable the CSS/JS Minify option in the Optimization Settings.

* If your server requires rewrite rules to be placed in a different file (e.g., a config file), consider upgrading to the <a target="_blank" href="https://wp-hide.com/wp-hide-pro-now-available/">WP Hide PRO</a> version, which includes a Setup page for generating the necessary rewrite code.

= How Do I Use the Plugin on a Bitnami Setup? =
By default, Bitnami LAMP setups do not process .htaccess files, so rewrites won’t work. To resolve this:

* Update the main config file located at /opt/bitnami/apps/APPNAME/conf/httpd-app.conf.

<pre><code>AllowOverride None</code></pre>
to
<pre><code>AllowOverride All</code></pre>  

* Restart the Apache service through SSH:
<pre><code>sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart</code></pre>

For more details, refer to the <a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/general/apps/redmine/administration/use-htaccess/">Bitnami documentation</a>.

You can still keep the configuration as it is using the <a target="_blank" href="https://wp-hide.com">WP Hide PRO</a>, more details at <a href="https://wp-hide.com/documentation/setup-the-plugin-on-bitnami-wordpress-lamp-stack/">Setup the plugin on Bitnami WordPress LAMP stack</a>

= .htaccess File Writing Error – Unable to Write Custom Rules =
If you see the error “Unable to write custom rules to your .htaccess. Is this file writable?”, follow these steps:

* Ensure the .htaccess file is writable (typically rw-rw-r– / 0664 permissions) and owned by the same group as PHP.

* Other plugins or themes might interfere with rewrite rules. Temporarily disable them to identify the culprit.

* Deactivate and reactivate the WP Hide plugin—this has resolved the issue for some users.

* Create a backup of your .htaccess file, delete it, and go to Settings > Permalinks to regenerate it. Then, update WP Hide settings to rewrite the .htaccess file.

= Something Went Wrong – How Can I Recover My Site? =
Don’t worry—your site will not be harmed. Here’s how to troubleshoot:

* Log in to your admin dashboard and adjust plugin settings to identify the issue. Report the problem on our forum or contact us for assistance.

* If you can’t access the admin area, use the Recovery Link sent to your email to reset the login to default.

* If the Recovery Link doesn’t work or you can’t find it, delete the plugin from the wp-content/plugins directory and remove any lines in your .htaccess file between:
 BEGIN WP Hide & Security Enhancer
..
 END WP Hide & Security Enhancer 
 
 * Your site should now function as before. If issues persist, contact us at contact@wp-hide.com, and we’ll help you resolve it quickly.

= How Do I Use the Recovery Link? =
The Recovery Link resets all plugin options and restores your site to its default state. To use it:

* Enter the link into your browser’s URL bar.

* After the process completes, you’ll see a message: “The plugin options have been reset successfully.”

* If the message doesn’t appear, clear your site’s cache (usually located in /wp-content/cache/) and reload the Recovery Link.

= What to do if I can’t find a functionality that I’m looking for? =

Please get in touch with us and we’ll do our best to include it inthe next version.
